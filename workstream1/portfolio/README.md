# Portfolio Allocation Strategy

A sketch of the procedures for facilitating 
the portfolio allocation strategy is as follows. 

## Evaluating Proposed Selection of Projects

1. Initialize database through bulk upload 
  or serial input of web forms. 
  
1. Financial officer at FCLF should have a web form
  to define allocation rule to projects. 
  That is, each project in the database could have a 
  selection button to consider the approval of each project
  which will together form a portfolio. 
  
a. The above form could have a switch for projects 
  already awarded funding. Selection buttons can be used 
  to select additional new projects as candidates for CMF funding.

1. The user (financial officer) pushes a button 
  to calculate metrics for selected portfolio of projects. 
  
1. Error or warning message is printed if any 
  selected project does not meet the eligibility criteria. 
  Dialogue box: "Are you sure?" Selecting "Yes" could 
  be used to evaluate hypothetical portfolio. 
  Selecting "No" moves back to project selection. 
  
1. A series of metrics are calculated for the overall portfolio. 
  a. Overall percentage of units in Areas of Economic Distress.
  a. Overall percentage of units in High-Opportunity
    Areas for Eligible_Income Families.
  a. Overall capital multiplier: the ratio of the sum of total
    project costs for all projects under consideration
    to the total amount of CMF funding across those projects.
  a. Overall percentage of rental-affordable housing units 
    designated for Very Low Income Families. 
  a. Metrics for each project, according to scores or predictions
    from workflow 2, including 
    value to community or probability of project failure.
    
1. If financial officer deems portfolio to be optimal, 
  officer can proceed to process newly-added applications
  for later stages of financing process. 
  
  

## Ranking of Projects to Determine Candidates for Selection

To inform the above procedure, the financial officer 
may want to review the projects according to a number of metrics. 


1. Overall percentage of units in Areas of Economic Distress.
1. Overall percentage of units in High-Opportunity
    Areas for Eligible_Income Families.
1. Overall capital multiplier: the ratio of the sum of total
    project costs for all projects under consideration
    to the total amount of CMF funding across those projects.
1. Overall percentage of rental-affordable housing units 
    designated for Very Low Income Families. 
1. Metrics for each project, according to scores or predictions
    from workflow 2, including 
    value to community or probability of project failure.
1. Calculate any other metrics that the officer deems to be important (which is another margin on which to obtain feedback).



How the FCLF staff will proceed depends on their preferences, 
which is an opportunity to obtain feedback from the potential
users of this new CMF tool. 


Perhaps the next stage is to create an index for an
overall ranking of the value of the project to the community. 
This would entail a rank-ordering of the projects, 
from which the financial officer would select the top-ranked
projects among those eligible for financing. 
Whether or not this works depends on whether the staff 
thinks it prudent to rank projects across a single dimension. 
In words, the developers of the CMT tool would
have to define a measurement of the overall contribution of 
a project.



Otherwise, the above metrics could be output to a spreadsheet,
so that the financial officer can sort the projects across
multiple criteria. 
The officer can then make a subjective evaluation
of the merits of the projects, 
which makes more sense if the projects are envisioned as 
having the potential for contributions along multiple dimensions. 
For example, some projects have a higher capital multiplier 
and will increase development, some will create 
a larger number of units made available for low-income families.
